# Russ's Buses Rentals

This is the client application for Russ's Buses Rentals: a website to rent party buses, adventure RVs and driven road trip buses.

People can create an account and submit reservation requests that contains preferred dates, and which bus appeals to them. Bus owners can then approve or deny the reservation, to create a rental.

Owners can view all their vehicles, and track how many times they've been rented, and all users can see how many miles they've traveled in a rental.
